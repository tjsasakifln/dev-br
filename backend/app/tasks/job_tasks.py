def process_generation_job(job_id: str):
    """Orchestrates the complete code generation process for a job.
    
    This asynchronous task handles the full lifecycle of code generation,
    from prompt analysis to final code delivery. It integrates with the
    open-swe AI engine to transform natural language descriptions into
    working full-stack applications.
    
    The task performs the following operations:
    1. Retrieves the job from the database
    2. Updates job status to 'processing'
    3. Analyzes the user prompt to determine tech stack and requirements
    4. Interfaces with the open-swe generation engine
    5. Validates generated code for syntax and basic functionality
    6. Persists the generated code and updates job status to 'completed'
    7. Handles error cases by updating status to 'failed' with error details
    
    Args:
        job_id (str): Unique identifier (UUID) of the generation job to process.
                     Must correspond to an existing GenerationJob in the database.
    
    Returns:
        str: Status message indicating the completion state of the processing.
             Format: "Processamento concluído para job: {job_id}" on success,
                    "Processamento falhou para job: {job_id}" on failure.
    
    Raises:
        Exception: Any unhandled errors during processing are logged and
                  the job status is updated to 'failed' before re-raising.
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Dispatch job asynchronously
        >>> result = process_generation_job.delay("550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")
        >>> result.get(timeout=300)  # Wait up to 5 minutes
        'Processamento concluído para job: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
        
        >>> # Check task status
        >>> result.status
        'SUCCESS'
    
    Note:
        This is currently a minimal implementation for the Green phase of TDD.
        Future iterations will include:
        - Full integration with the open-swe AI generation engine
        - Real-time progress updates and status streaming
        - Advanced error handling and retry mechanisms
        - Code validation and testing pipeline
        - GitHub repository creation and deployment automation
